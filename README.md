Rails Bootstrap3 AJAX example
=============================

Credit
------

This example is taken from http://richonrails.com/articles/basic-ajax-in-ruby-on-rails with thanks.
The only changes from that site's instructions are those needed for compatibility with Bootstrap 3
and the additional files created as part of the Rails setup, and the use of different example data.

Note that the original version has a problem in the creation of new database items and this problem
hasn't been fixed in this version.  I'd be happy to receive a pull request to fix that.

Please see the instructions at the link above for information about the example.
